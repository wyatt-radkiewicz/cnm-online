CNM Online
=================

CNM Online source code.
* CNM Online is a game that I have been working on developing for the past few years,
* The current version uses SDL2, but older versions used rendering methods written in amd64 assembly and with SIMD extensions to make it 7x faster than naive methods.
* It uses its own netcode library that sends snapshots of the game state over to clients using delta compression and lossy compression of certain fields.
